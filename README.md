## [Here](https://github.com/Kyle2Miles93/kung-fu-web-scraping) is a link to a similar martial art related repository in my Github account. It's very much in the works at the moment. ðŸ’ªðŸ“– --- also here ðŸ‘‰ [kung-fu-web-scraping](https://github.com/Kyle2Miles93/kung-fu-web-scraping)
   --------------------------

Note:
###### This is a java project exported from Eclipse IDE. In retrospect, it is much easier to manipulate within Eclipse than in VS Code.

## Purpose 
* Testing out some OOP java code for practice's sake. Content includes Kung Fu teacher's bios.
* to understand how the following works within VS Code:
  * JRE compiler
  * JDK (Java development Tool Kit)
  * packages + class relationships within a conventional Java file structure framework
 
* Chinese martial arts interests me. 
  * Studied ***Hung Gar*** kung fu, a southern style derived from the Shaolin temple, at age 8
  * The origins, philosophy, and development are shaped in large part to each style's practictioners / teachers
  * Studied ***Wing Chun*** kung fu, a southern style invented by a woman, at age 18
