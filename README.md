## Purpose 
* Testing out some OOP java code for practice's sake. Content includes Kung Fu teacher's bios.
* to understand how the following works within VS Code:
 1. JRE compiler
 2. JDK (Java development Tool Kit)
 3. packages + class relationships within a conventional Java file structure framework
 
* Chinese martial arts interests me. 
  * Started hung gar kung fu, a southern Chinese style derived from the Shaolin temple, at age 8
